build_buy_questions:
    -
        title: "1. Are you sure you know the best workflow?"
        body: "With dozens of data standards multiplied by hundreds of EHR options, understanding the best data exchange strategy is not a given. There are likely optimizations to increase data fidelity, reduce complexity, and minimize costs."
    -
        title: "2. Does your team have the diversity of expertise needed?"
        body: "A typical integration requires expertise in VPNs, modern cloud DevOps, encryption, integration engines, HL7 or other data standards like FHIR or DICOM, and Epic or other EHRs like Cerner or Allscripts. Each requires expert level experience."
    -
        title: "3. What happens if the VPN goes down at 3am?"
        body: "Remember that integrations are always point-to-point and established through secure connectivity like VPNs. Those VPNs need to stay alive. Should a VPN go down, it's your responsibility to ensure it's back up again as soon as possible. For mission critical apps, any downtime could threaten lives. Are you staffed and ready to shoulder that responsibility?"
    -
        title: "4. Have you factored in all integration engine costs?"
        body: "If you decide to do integrations on your own, an integration engine is required. The visible cost of an integration engine is the license, which can range from tens-of-thousands of dollars to free if you choose an open source option like Mirth. The true cost of an integration includes several invisible costs, however, like HIPAA compliant infrastructure, logs, data storage, and backup."
    -
        title: "5. Is your infrastructure HITRUST certified? Are your logs HIPAA compliant?"
        body: "You need to put your integration engine, logs, database, and files somewhere. Is that somewhere a HITRUST certified, HIPAA compliant environment? Creating and maintaining HIPAA compliant infrastructure is its own world of expertise beyond the scope of integration. It's so large costs will run hundreds of thousands of dollars."
    -
        title: "6. What is your backup plan?"
        body: "Often the data exchanged in an integration must be backed up for the purposes of audits, reports, external computing, or disaster recovery. Do you have a backup plan established specific to each integration? Don't forget those need to be HIPAA compliant as well."
    -
        title: "7. Are you achieving economies of scale?"
        body: "The cardinal rule of integrations: there is no scale. Each integration is point-to-point, meaning the wheel must be reinvented every time, meaning new VPNs, new infrastructure, and workflow mappings, and more. If you plan to build and maintain all your integrations, are you achieving the scale needed to reduce costs as you grow? Or are you compounding your costs with each new integration?"
    -
        title: "8. Do you have a FHIR transition plan?"
        body: "The future of healthcare integrations will be FHIR-enabled because the industry has bought into the value of having resource-based, RESTful-style connections. But most institutions are still using decades-old technology with slow plans to switch. Do you have a plan in place to handle FHIR in the future while straddling the technologies of the past?"
    -
        title: "9. Is your sales team prepped to communicate the value?"
        body: "Integrations still need to have business value, even though there is no denying their importance to bettering patient care and improving business outcomes. In order for hospitals and vendors to see the value of an integration, they must both be sold. Do you have the training programs ready and collateral prepped for your sales team to accurately communicate the value?"
    -
        title: "10. Do you have the legal resources to manage each new Business Associate Agreement that comes with each new integration?"
        body: "Don't forget you need to have a BAA established in order to complete an integration. Here's the tricky part: Often each new BAA will be slightly different than the last. It's now up to you to juggle each agreement and ensure alignment when bad things happen."

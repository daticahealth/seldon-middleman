            Other Platform-as-a-Service options do not cover the full scope of HIPAA compliance. None cover HITRUST, GxP, and GDPR. Compare [Our BAA] to other options when researching.

            All other installable technologies aren't platforms meant to greatest compliance coverage with the best experience. Instead, you pay for consultant service fees.

#         AWS and Azure provide VPCs, which cover a portion of compliance and security requirements.

#         Within a VPC, the Datica Platform is installed. Everything within the Platform is strictly managed in adherence to Datica policies. The Platform uses a combination of Kubernetes and proprietary technology to orchestrate all DevOps duties for customers.

#         Customers create an account within the Datica Platform. It is through the account that they gain access to HIPAA-eligible AWS Primitives or Azure Services, which are strictly controlled by the Platform.

#         Within a customer account, the Platform containerizes all technology required to meet compliance controls from HIPAA, HITRUST, GDPR, and GxP. Things like logging, intrusion detection, and penetration testing, to name a few.

#         Customers deploy their applications to containerized environments. They can have multiple environments within their Datica account, managing any type of technical use case.

#         Administration of AWS Primitives or Azure Services are no longer required. Instead, customers simply allocate RAM to individual containers. Datica takes care of the rest.

#         Deployment is done either through a `git push` buildpack-based process or by pushing custom Docker containers.

shared_responsibility:
    - |
        AWS and Azure are the world's best clouds at addressing compliance and security _of_ the cloud: physical controls and network controls. The rest is your responsibility.

        In their Shared Responsibility models, you must address the following on top of them in order to approach complete continuous compliance. The following list maps to a specific control in the HIPAA Omnibus, HITRUST CSF, GxP regulations, or GDPR articles.
    - |
        - Block-level encryption
        - Network encryption between existing processes or services
        - Sub-network segmentation
        - Intrusion detection
        - Vulnerability scanning
        - Systems monitoring
        - System-level logging
        - App-level logging
        - Log storage in an encrypted fashion
        - Disaster recovery protocols
        - Business continuity
        - Patch management
        - Breach management
        - Daily backups
        - Penetration testing
        - Business Associate management
        - Access control management

        None of it is impossible for you to figure out. But configuring, integrating, documenting, auditing, and managing it across a fleet of containers or VMs with every deployment is how continuous compliance happens.

        Datica does all this for you. We are compliance _on_ the cloud. Customers of Datica pass these Shared Responsibility obligations to us and are left with compliance _in_ the cloud, which are company-level and application-level responsibilities.

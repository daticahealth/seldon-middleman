        p.lead Datica was formed in 2013 to help healthcare technology companies move to the cloud. We help our customers <a class="" href="/cloud-compliance" title="Read more about cloud compliance">achieve HIPAA compliance</a>, <a class="" href="/ehr-integration" title="Learn about EHR integration">integrate securely</a> with hospitals and EHRs, and focus on what they're best at â€” without worrying about compliance. We're the experts at understanding the exact policies and procedures required to turn HIPAA-eligible services on the public cloud into architectures that can pass a HITRUST CSF assessment.

              h3.headline-4 The Most Secure and Compliant Infrastructure Possible
              p The hardest part about compliance on the cloud is between the physical infrastructure (which is the responsibility of AWS, Azure, or GCP) and the customer application. In another words, the operating system layer of cloud native architectures. We solve that by helping customers address attestation responsibilities with a suite of products built to fit the specific use case on the cloud.

              p By mapping the very best compliance management frameworks, like the HITRUST CSF, to the requirements of other global regimes, we give customers a compliance story across geographies. We started with HIPAA in 2013, tackling the requirements of the most conservative and highest regulated industry on the cloud, and have expanded since then.

              p When regulated organizations have a handle on their cloud compliance program, they can innovate at the speed necessary to keep pace with the competition. It's a disruptive world out there, and the cloud gives companies an edge. Controlling compliance on the cloud is a step towards avoiding disruption.

                li Compliance moves at the <strong>speed of trust</strong>.
                li <strong>Transparency</strong> is how complex subjects, like HIPAA or GDPR, become easier to understand. We're trusted because we're transparent.
                li Healthcare application development shouldn't be harder than other industries just because of HIPAA. Doing business in the European Union shouldn't be harder because of GDPR. <strong>Compliance shouldn't block progress</strong>.

                li We know we can't make the cloud better alone. <strong>Industry collaboration</strong> is important. Work together for the greater good.
                li We are <strong>"solutions-first"</strong>. This means Datica brings our deep healthcare, compliance, and integration expertise to work with customers to find the optimal solution â€” not a prefab, off-the-shelf product.
